Web Publishing - Simple Little Thing

This little web publishing / blogging app is a very simple front-end for people who want to write and publish online, without needing to learn all the complexities of blogging platforms.

Over the years, we have made tremendous strides in terms of evolving and maturing our platforms. Unfortunately, this increasing complexity (while fun for many of us) can be a gating factor for those just getting started... or those who just don't have a lot of discretionary time to learn how to change settings and configure stuff 'n' whatnot.

The goal of wp-slt (or, as I like to call it wp:slt - github won't let me use a colon, sadly) is to make publishing blog posts and simple web pages accessible for everyone who wants to do it. When I got started building websites back in 1995, it was much more possible, than it is today.

And I think it can be again.

Watch this space for more updates - I got the first version working with create / update capabilities, and I'm going to let it rest overnight, to make sure I'm not missing anything. I mean, I probably have missed something, and I'll have to fix it later, but I want it to at least work well, right out of the gate. Accessibility means not breaking into a million different pieces, just 'cause you look at something sideways.
